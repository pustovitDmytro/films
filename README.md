## How to Install:
To install and launch project run theese commands in console:
```
yarn assemble
yarn start:http-server
```
That should start App in your browser, anyway you could check it on localhost:7000
To start webpack dev-server without assembing project run:
```
yarn start:dev-server
```

If you need just to build the app (without running a dev server), simply run:
```
yarn assemble:release
```
or
```
yarn assemble
```
to build in debug mode.
